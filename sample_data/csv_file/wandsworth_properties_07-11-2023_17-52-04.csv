At 626 sqft, there is plenty of room here and there is a lovely balance of space, light and sense of proportion. it benefits from a large, private, south facing roof terrace  with glass balustrade,  accessed by double doors. One can enjoy the south-facing roof terrace in the summer - perfect for those afternoon drinks and BBQ at the weekend!  NB the vendor owns the freehold of the building.<br /><br />This area has always been immensely popular and the location is special with both Wandsworth Common, Clapham Common and Northcote Road within minute's walk, whilst  Marks and Spencers, and Waitrose are within a 2-minute walk. It has deservedly earned itself the reputation as a great place to live.
